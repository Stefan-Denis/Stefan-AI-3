<p><b>Motto: </b>”Stefan AI 3 is incredible. Therefore, when a supposed Version 4 comes out, it will be the most successful software made.”</p>

<p>Before starting, I would like to announce that version 3 will be a very long-term solution. Maybe 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 will exist, but 4.0 will not come soon, thats for sure. Just like Windows 10 or perhaps GTA 5, we will use the exisiting platform until it literally can't be used anymore and we will have to innovate once again.</p>

    Stefan AI 3 improves in many ways over Stefan AI 2. It has a better UI,
    it is more cost-efficient, it is more faster, yet it  integrates <b>NEW</b> features that will maximise your profits on social media. <br />

<h3 style="font-size: 1.7rem; margin-top: 20px">The brand new <b>Theme Editor</b></h3>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
    The revised app has new, cutting-edge features, such as this easy to use <b>Theme Editor</b>
</p>
<p>
    The theme editor provides the user with a very easy to use <b>interface,</b> which allows you to specify to the  system, how to process each video.

<h3 style="font-size: 1.7rem; margin-top: 20px">Powerful Configuration File</h3>

<p>
    The <b>Powerful</b> configuration file in the .jsonc format was kept from the old app. It allows a lot of user control. An <b>experienced</b> user, with trial and error, can use this file and make videos <b>better </b> than <b> most video editors</b> can, in just <b>2 minutes.</b>

<p>
    Using a <b>”Fine-Tuned” OpenAI LLM</b>, the app can produce <b>high-quality</b> video scripts.
    The app is trained to return the output in a special <b>.json</b> format:
