* What Stefan-AI V3.0 will accomplish:
1. The new app will have a companion mobile app that will send notifications to your phone just in case an error occours.
2. The app will focus on improving on the old app
3. The app will use a new ”Parallel-Processing” system to quickly process data.

* What will we use from the old app:
1. We will still use FFMPEG and Montreal Forced Aligner to create the videos.
2. We will still use the same AI model from the last app.
3. We will still use the same ”profile” system from the last app, to determine how to create videos.

* What will be new:
1. The app will have imrpoved error handling
2. The code will be easier to maintain
3. The app will have better documentation on how to install it + the required dependencies
4. We will plan out the UI + everything better.
5. Speed is the main focus. We will try to make the app as fast as possible.
6. The UI will be better
7. The app will have an integrated terminal so that it won't open the windows terminal.
8. Apart from installing the dependencies, the app will be portable. You can just copy it from one computer to another and it will work,
   provided that it has windows 11 or 10 installed.
9. There will be better code documentation and the code will be organised better.

* AI: 
1. The AI will be the same as the last app. We will use the same model.
2. This time, we will train it a bit better, feed it a few more examples (around 10 - 15 new datasets) and we will try to make it more accurate.
   It already is pretty good, JSON validation is the only thing that we have to implement better.

* UI:
1. The UI will be built in React
2. The app will use any windows technology to start the window except WinUi3, since its not that portable.

* Backend:
1. The backend will be built in TypeScript, using a bundled in NodeJS.
2. We will need a method to tranfer data from the client to the backend. Some sort of WebSocket Server or something like that.

* Code:
1. The code will be better documented
2. The code will be better organised
3. The code will be easier to maintain
4. The code will be easier to understand
5. The code will be easier to read
6. The code will be easier to debug
7. The code will be easier to test
8. The code will be split into different files.
9. The focus will be on modularity and reusability for future projects.
